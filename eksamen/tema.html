            Cities are arenas of formal and casual interaction between different professions, 
            different companies and organizations, and different groups of people. 
            This can provide a fertile ground for innovation. 
            What is innovation? Tor Paaske Utheim at Department of Research and Development, 
            OsloMet, will give an answer to this in the first video. In the second video, Jessica Giannoumis at University College Cork,
            will talk about the role of clusters in innovation.

        <p id="pTema"> 
            Good ideas, access to collaboration partners, and access to financing are important elements in an innovation process. 
            Another crucial element is insight about the potential users and the use context. 
            In the following video, Max Tangen, CEO in 7Sense Products, will explain how his company has used the method 
            'design driven innovation' to develop relevant and attractive products for their customers.

            Every now and then a new technology brings about profound societal changes. 
            Is the electric scooter a radical innovation with the capacity to change urban living significantly? 
            Hanne Cecilie Geirbo, Associate Professor at Department of Computer Science, OsloMet, will speculate on this by looking at 
            the electric scooters through the lenses of transport, big data and machine learning, universal design, and sustainability.

            The digitization of health- and welfare services can be a means of spending scarce resources more efficiently. 
            Digital services can also provide flexibility so that clients and patients will be better able to integrate treatment 
            and welfare programs in their daily life. At the same time, there are challenges connected to the 
            digitization in the health- and welfare sector.

        <p id="pTema">
            In the first video, Anders Underthun, senior researcher at the Work Research Institute at OsloMet, 
            will present a case of how home care services have been digitized in a Norwegian municipality. 
            He will show how the introduction of digital work-lists makes it easier for the nurses to meet the varying needs of their 
            patients, and also point out some challenges that arise when face-to-face communication with colleagues is replaced 
            with digital communication.

        <p id="pTema">
            Digitization does not necessarily imply turning an existing paper-based system into a digital replica. 
            The following video will present how NAV, the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration, 
            approaches digitization as an opportunity for transformation.

            Digital technology has opened new ways of collecting data and new ways of processing data. 
            This has expanded the possibilities for how data about a city can be gathered and how this data can be combined 
            and analyzed to give insights that can be used in planning and administration. In this video, Marikken Wullf Wathne, 
            Ph.D. candidate at NIBR - Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research, will elaborate on how digital technologies 
            are being used in what is commonly known as "smart city" - initiatives, and present some of the debates around the 
            digitization of urban governance.
